with annual inflation in the US now reaching a serious level of 6.2%, compared with a less troublesome 4.1% in the eurozone,
the feeling is that the Fed will end its asset purchases sooner. This is because increasing the money supply has the potential to stoke inflation.
Indeed, the Fed has recently already started “tapering” or slowing down the rate of QE with a view to stopping it in the second half of 2022.
On the other hand, the ECB has been discussing a replacement for its US$2.2 trillion (£1.7 trillion) QE programme when it ends in March 2022.

These inflows come at a time when the rupee has weakened sharply by about ₹2/dollar in the last 13 days amid escalating war between Russia and Ukraine,
surging crude oil prices, foreign investors pulling out from Indian equities, and the fear of a widening current account deficit.

The current swap may have helped withdraw about ₹37,500 crore of durable liquidity from the banking system,
but the comfort of close to ₹7.3 lakh crore of systemic liquidity should offset short-term liquidity disruptions from GST outflows or the increased T-Bill auction amount.
